Invalid property specified for object of type plotly.graph_objs.Layout: 'label'

    Valid properties:
        angularaxis
            plotly.graph_objs.layout.AngularAxis instance or dict
            with compatible properties
        annotations
            plotly.graph_objs.layout.Annotation instance or dict
            with compatible properties
        annotationdefaults
            When used in a template (as
            layout.template.layout.annotationdefaults), sets the
            default property values to use for elements of
            layout.annotations
        autosize
            Determines whether or not a layout width or height that
            has been left undefined by the user is initialized on
            each relayout. Note that, regardless of this attribute,
            an undefined layout width or height is always
            initialized on the first call to plot.
        bargap
            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of
            adjacent location coordinates.
        bargroupgap
            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of the
            same location coordinate.
        barmode
            Determines how bars at the same location coordinate are
            displayed on the graph. With "stack", the bars are
            stacked on top of one another With "relative", the bars
            are stacked on top of one another, with negative values
            below the axis, positive values above With "group", the
            bars are plotted next to one another centered around
            the shared location. With "overlay", the bars are
            plotted over one another, you might need to an
            "opacity" to see multiple bars.
        barnorm
            Sets the normalization for bar traces on the graph.
            With "fraction", the value of each bar is divided by
            the sum of all values at that location coordinate.
            "percent" is the same but multiplied by 100 to show
            percentages.
        boxgap
            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between boxes of
            adjacent location coordinates. Has no effect on traces
            that have "width" set.
        boxgroupgap
            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between boxes of the
            same location coordinate. Has no effect on traces that
            have "width" set.
        boxmode
            Determines how boxes at the same location coordinate
            are displayed on the graph. If "group", the boxes are
            plotted next to one another centered around the shared
            location. If "overlay", the boxes are plotted over one
            another, you might need to set "opacity" to see them
            multiple boxes. Has no effect on traces that have
            "width" set.
        calendar
            Sets the default calendar system to use for
            interpreting and displaying dates throughout the plot.
        clickmode
            Determines the mode of single click interactions.
            "event" is the default value and emits the
            `plotly_click` event. In addition this mode emits the
            `plotly_selected` event in drag modes "lasso" and
            "select", but with no event data attached (kept for
            compatibility reasons). The "select" flag enables
            selecting single data points via click. This mode also
            supports persistent selections, meaning that pressing
            Shift while clicking, adds to / subtracts from an
            existing selection. "select" with `hovermode`: "x" can
            be confusing, consider explicitly setting `hovermode`:
            "closest" when using this feature. Selection events are
            sent accordingly as long as "event" flag is set as
            well. When the "event" flag is missing, `plotly_click`
            and `plotly_selected` events are not fired.
        coloraxis
            plotly.graph_objs.layout.Coloraxis instance or dict
            with compatible properties
        colorscale
            plotly.graph_objs.layout.Colorscale instance or dict
            with compatible properties
        colorway
            Sets the default trace colors.
        datarevision
            If provided, a changed value tells `Plotly.react` that
            one or more data arrays has changed. This way you can
            modify arrays in-place rather than making a complete
            new copy for an incremental change. If NOT provided,
            `Plotly.react` assumes that data arrays are being
            treated as immutable, thus any data array with a
            different identity from its predecessor contains new
            data.
        direction
            Legacy polar charts are deprecated! Please switch to
            "polar" subplots. Sets the direction corresponding to
            positive angles in legacy polar charts.
        dragmode
            Determines the mode of drag interactions. "select" and
            "lasso" apply only to scatter traces with markers or
            text. "orbit" and "turntable" apply only to 3D scenes.
        editrevision
            Controls persistence of user-driven changes in
            `editable: true` configuration, other than trace names
            and axis titles. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
        extendfunnelareacolors
            If `true`, the funnelarea slice colors (whether given
            by `funnelareacolorway` or inherited from `colorway`)
            will be extended to three times its original length by
            first repeating every color 20% lighter then each color
            20% darker. This is intended to reduce the likelihood
            of reusing the same color when you have many slices,
            but you can set `false` to disable. Colors provided in
            the trace, using `marker.colors`, are never extended.
        extendpiecolors
            If `true`, the pie slice colors (whether given by
            `piecolorway` or inherited from `colorway`) will be
            extended to three times its original length by first
            repeating every color 20% lighter then each color 20%
            darker. This is intended to reduce the likelihood of
            reusing the same color when you have many slices, but
            you can set `false` to disable. Colors provided in the
            trace, using `marker.colors`, are never extended.
        extendsunburstcolors
            If `true`, the sunburst slice colors (whether given by
            `sunburstcolorway` or inherited from `colorway`) will
            be extended to three times its original length by first
            repeating every color 20% lighter then each color 20%
            darker. This is intended to reduce the likelihood of
            reusing the same color when you have many slices, but
            you can set `false` to disable. Colors provided in the
            trace, using `marker.colors`, are never extended.
        font
            Sets the global font. Note that fonts used in traces
            and other layout components inherit from the global
            font.
        funnelareacolorway
            Sets the default funnelarea slice colors. Defaults to
            the main `colorway` used for trace colors. If you
            specify a new list here it can still be extended with
            lighter and darker colors, see
            `extendfunnelareacolors`.
        funnelgap
            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of
            adjacent location coordinates.
        funnelgroupgap
            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of the
            same location coordinate.
        funnelmode
            Determines how bars at the same location coordinate are
            displayed on the graph. With "stack", the bars are
            stacked on top of one another With "group", the bars
            are plotted next to one another centered around the
            shared location. With "overlay", the bars are plotted
            over one another, you might need to an "opacity" to see
            multiple bars.
        geo
            plotly.graph_objs.layout.Geo instance or dict with
            compatible properties
        grid
            plotly.graph_objs.layout.Grid instance or dict with
            compatible properties
        height
            Sets the plot's height (in px).
        hiddenlabels
            hiddenlabels is the funnelarea & pie chart analog of
            visible:'legendonly' but it can contain many labels,
            and can simultaneously hide slices from several
            pies/funnelarea charts
        hiddenlabelssrc
            Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hiddenlabels
            .
        hidesources
            Determines whether or not a text link citing the data
            source is placed at the bottom-right cored of the
            figure. Has only an effect only on graphs that have
            been generated via forked graphs from the plotly
            service (at https://plot.ly or on-premise).
        hoverdistance
            Sets the default distance (in pixels) to look for data
            to add hover labels (-1 means no cutoff, 0 means no
            looking for data). This is only a real distance for
            hovering on point-like objects, like scatter points.
            For area-like objects (bars, scatter fills, etc)
            hovering is on inside the area and off outside, but
            these objects will not supersede hover on point-like
            objects in case of conflict.
        hoverlabel
            plotly.graph_objs.layout.Hoverlabel instance or dict
            with compatible properties
        hovermode
            Determines the mode of hover interactions. If
            `clickmode` includes the "select" flag, `hovermode`
            defaults to "closest". If `clickmode` lacks the
            "select" flag, it defaults to "x" or "y" (depending on
            the trace's `orientation` value) for plots based on
            cartesian coordinates. For anything else the default
            value is "closest".
        images
            plotly.graph_objs.layout.Image instance or dict with
            compatible properties
        imagedefaults
            When used in a template (as
            layout.template.layout.imagedefaults), sets the default
            property values to use for elements of layout.images
        legend
            plotly.graph_objs.layout.Legend instance or dict with
            compatible properties
        mapbox
            plotly.graph_objs.layout.Mapbox instance or dict with
            compatible properties
        margin
            plotly.graph_objs.layout.Margin instance or dict with
            compatible properties
        meta
            Assigns extra meta information that can be used in
            various `text` attributes. Attributes such as the
            graph, axis and colorbar `title.text`, annotation
            `text` `trace.name` in legend items, `rangeselector`,
            `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label` text all support
            `meta`. One can access `meta` fields using template
            strings: `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index of the
            `meta` item in question. `meta` can also be an object
            for example `{key: value}` which can be accessed
            %{meta[key]}.
        metasrc
            Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  meta .
        modebar
            plotly.graph_objs.layout.Modebar instance or dict with
            compatible properties
        orientation
            Legacy polar charts are deprecated! Please switch to
            "polar" subplots. Rotates the entire polar by the given
            angle in legacy polar charts.
        paper_bgcolor
            Sets the color of paper where the graph is drawn.
        piecolorway
            Sets the default pie slice colors. Defaults to the main
            `colorway` used for trace colors. If you specify a new
            list here it can still be extended with lighter and
            darker colors, see `extendpiecolors`.
        plot_bgcolor
            Sets the color of plotting area in-between x and y
            axes.
        polar
            plotly.graph_objs.layout.Polar instance or dict with
            compatible properties
        radialaxis
            plotly.graph_objs.layout.RadialAxis instance or dict
            with compatible properties
        scene
            plotly.graph_objs.layout.Scene instance or dict with
            compatible properties
        selectdirection
            When "dragmode" is set to "select", this limits the
            selection of the drag to horizontal, vertical or
            diagonal. "h" only allows horizontal selection, "v"
            only vertical, "d" only diagonal and "any" sets no
            limit.
        selectionrevision
            Controls persistence of user-driven changes in selected
            points from all traces.
        separators
            Sets the decimal and thousand separators. For example,
            *. * puts a '.' before decimals and a space between
            thousands. In English locales, dflt is ".," but other
            locales may alter this default.
        shapes
            plotly.graph_objs.layout.Shape instance or dict with
            compatible properties
        shapedefaults
            When used in a template (as
            layout.template.layout.shapedefaults), sets the default
            property values to use for elements of layout.shapes
        showlegend
            Determines whether or not a legend is drawn. Default is
            `true` if there is a trace to show and any of these: a)
            Two or more traces would by default be shown in the
            legend. b) One pie trace is shown in the legend. c) One
            trace is explicitly given with `showlegend: true`.
        sliders
            plotly.graph_objs.layout.Slider instance or dict with
            compatible properties
        sliderdefaults
            When used in a template (as
            layout.template.layout.sliderdefaults), sets the
            default property values to use for elements of
            layout.sliders
        spikedistance
            Sets the default distance (in pixels) to look for data
            to draw spikelines to (-1 means no cutoff, 0 means no
            looking for data). As with hoverdistance, distance does
            not apply to area-like objects. In addition, some
            objects can be hovered on but will not generate
            spikelines, such as scatter fills.
        sunburstcolorway
            Sets the default sunburst slice colors. Defaults to the
            main `colorway` used for trace colors. If you specify a
            new list here it can still be extended with lighter and
            darker colors, see `extendsunburstcolors`.
        template
            Default attributes to be applied to the plot. This
            should be a dict with format: `{'layout':
            layoutTemplate, 'data': {trace_type: [traceTemplate,
            ...], ...}}` where `layoutTemplate` is a dict matching
            the structure of `figure.layout` and `traceTemplate` is
            a dict matching the structure of the trace with type
            `trace_type` (e.g. 'scatter'). Alternatively, this may
            be specified as an instance of
            plotly.graph_objs.layout.Template.  Trace templates are
            applied cyclically to traces of each type. Container
            arrays (eg `annotations`) have special handling: An
            object ending in `defaults` (eg `annotationdefaults`)
            is applied to each array item. But if an item has a
            `templateitemname` key we look in the template array
            for an item with matching `name` and apply that
            instead. If no matching `name` is found we mark the
            item invisible. Any named template item not referenced
            is appended to the end of the array, so this can be
            used to add a watermark annotation or a logo image, for
            example. To omit one of these items on the plot, make
            an item with matching `templateitemname` and `visible:
            false`.
        ternary
            plotly.graph_objs.layout.Ternary instance or dict with
            compatible properties
        title
            plotly.graph_objs.layout.Title instance or dict with
            compatible properties
        titlefont
            Deprecated: Please use layout.title.font instead. Sets
            the title font. Note that the title's font used to be
            customized by the now deprecated `titlefont` attribute.
        transition
            Sets transition options used during Plotly.react
            updates.
        uirevision
            Used to allow user interactions with the plot to
            persist after `Plotly.react` calls that are unaware of
            these interactions. If `uirevision` is omitted, or if
            it is given and it changed from the previous
            `Plotly.react` call, the exact new figure is used. If
            `uirevision` is truthy and did NOT change, any
            attribute that has been affected by user interactions
            and did not receive a different value in the new figure
            will keep the interaction value. `layout.uirevision`
            attribute serves as the default for `uirevision`
            attributes in various sub-containers. For finer control
            you can set these sub-attributes directly. For example,
            if your app separately controls the data on the x and y
            axes you might set `xaxis.uirevision=*time*` and
            `yaxis.uirevision=*cost*`. Then if only the y data is
            changed, you can update `yaxis.uirevision=*quantity*`
            and the y axis range will reset but the x axis range
            will retain any user-driven zoom.
        updatemenus
            plotly.graph_objs.layout.Updatemenu instance or dict
            with compatible properties
        updatemenudefaults
            When used in a template (as
            layout.template.layout.updatemenudefaults), sets the
            default property values to use for elements of
            layout.updatemenus
        violingap
            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between violins of
            adjacent location coordinates. Has no effect on traces
            that have "width" set.
        violingroupgap
            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between violins of the
            same location coordinate. Has no effect on traces that
            have "width" set.
        violinmode
            Determines how violins at the same location coordinate
            are displayed on the graph. If "group", the violins are
            plotted next to one another centered around the shared
            location. If "overlay", the violins are plotted over
            one another, you might need to set "opacity" to see
            them multiple violins. Has no effect on traces that
            have "width" set.
        waterfallgap
            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of
            adjacent location coordinates.
        waterfallgroupgap
            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of the
            same location coordinate.
        waterfallmode
            Determines how bars at the same location coordinate are
            displayed on the graph. With "group", the bars are
            plotted next to one another centered around the shared
            location. With "overlay", the bars are plotted over one
            another, you might need to an "opacity" to see multiple
            bars.
        width

    Valid properties:
        alignmentgroup
            Set several traces linked to the same position axis or
            matching axes to the same alignmentgroup. This controls
            whether bars compute their positional range dependently
            or independently.
        base
            Sets where the bar base is drawn (in position axis
            units). In "stack" or "relative" barmode, traces that
            set "base" will be excluded and drawn in "overlay" mode
            instead.
        basesrc
            Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  base .
        cliponaxis
            Determines whether the text nodes are clipped about the
            subplot axes. To show the text nodes above axis lines
            and tick labels, make sure to set `xaxis.layer` and
            `yaxis.layer` to *below traces*.
        constraintext
            Constrain the size of text inside or outside a bar to
            be no larger than the bar itself.
        customdata
            Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
            listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
            that, "scatter" traces also appends customdata items in
            the markers DOM elements
        customdatasrc
            Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .
        dx
            Sets the x coordinate step. See `x0` for more info.
        dy
            Sets the y coordinate step. See `y0` for more info.
        error_x
            plotly.graph_objs.bar.ErrorX instance or dict with
            compatible properties
        error_y
            plotly.graph_objs.bar.ErrorY instance or dict with
            compatible properties
        hoverinfo
            Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
            `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
            upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
            events are still fired.
        hoverinfosrc
            Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hoverinfo .
        hoverlabel
            plotly.graph_objs.bar.Hoverlabel instance or dict with
            compatible properties
        hovertemplate
            Template string used for rendering the information that
            appear on hover box. Note that this will override
            `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
            for example "y: %{y}". Numbers are formatted using
            d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
            "Price: %{y:$.2f}". See https://github.com/d3/d3-format
            /blob/master/README.md#locale_format for details on the
            formatting syntax. The variables available in
            `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data
            described at this link
            https://plot.ly/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data.
            Additionally, every attributes that can be specified
            per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`) are
            available.  Anything contained in tag `<extra>` is
            displayed in the secondary box, for example
            "<extra>{fullData.name}</extra>". To hide the secondary
            box completely, use an empty tag `<extra></extra>`.
        hovertemplatesrc
            Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertemplate
            .
        hovertext
            Sets hover text elements associated with each (x,y)
            pair. If a single string, the same string appears over
            all the data points. If an array of string, the items
            are mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y)
            coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain
            a "text" flag.
        hovertextsrc
            Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertext .
        ids
            Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
            constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
            array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
        idssrc
            Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  ids .
        insidetextanchor
            Determines if texts are kept at center or start/end
            points in `textposition` "inside" mode.
        insidetextfont
            Sets the font used for `text` lying inside the bar.
        legendgroup
            Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of
            the same legend group hide/show at the same time when
            toggling legend items.
        marker
            plotly.graph_objs.bar.Marker instance or dict with
            compatible properties
        meta
            Assigns extra meta information associated with this
            trace that can be used in various text attributes.
            Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
            colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
            `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
            text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
            index.
        metasrc
            Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  meta .
        name
            Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
            legend item and on hover.
        offset
            Shifts the position where the bar is drawn (in position
            axis units). In "group" barmode, traces that set
            "offset" will be excluded and drawn in "overlay" mode
            instead.
        offsetgroup
            Set several traces linked to the same position axis or
            matching axes to the same offsetgroup where bars of the
            same position coordinate will line up.
        offsetsrc
            Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  offset .
        opacity
            Sets the opacity of the trace.
        orientation
            Sets the orientation of the bars. With "v" ("h"), the
            value of the each bar spans along the vertical
            (horizontal).
        outsidetextfont
            Sets the font used for `text` lying outside the bar.
        r
            r coordinates in scatter traces are deprecated!Please
            switch to the "scatterpolar" trace type.Sets the radial
            coordinatesfor legacy polar chart only.
        rsrc
            Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  r .
        selected
            plotly.graph_objs.bar.Selected instance or dict with
            compatible properties
        selectedpoints
            Array containing integer indices of selected points.
            Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
            Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
            the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
            any other non-array values means no selection all where
            the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
        showlegend
            Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
            trace is shown in the legend.
        stream
            plotly.graph_objs.bar.Stream instance or dict with
            compatible properties
        t
            t coordinates in scatter traces are deprecated!Please
            switch to the "scatterpolar" trace type.Sets the
            angular coordinatesfor legacy polar chart only.
        text
            Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If
            a single string, the same string appears over all the
            data points. If an array of string, the items are
            mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y) coordinates.
            If trace `hoverinfo` contains a "text" flag and
            "hovertext" is not set, these elements will be seen in
            the hover labels.
        textangle
            Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the
            bar. For example, a `tickangle` of -90 draws the tick
            labels vertically. With "auto" the texts may
            automatically be rotated to fit with the maximum size
            in bars.
        textfont
            Sets the font used for `text`.
        textposition
            Specifies the location of the `text`. "inside"
            positions `text` inside, next to the bar end (rotated
            and scaled if needed). "outside" positions `text`
            outside, next to the bar end (scaled if needed), unless
            there is another bar stacked on this one, then the text
            gets pushed inside. "auto" tries to position `text`
            inside the bar, but if the bar is too small and no bar
            is stacked on this one the text is moved outside.
        textpositionsrc
            Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  textposition
            .
        textsrc
            Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  text .
        tsrc
            Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  t .
        uid
            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
            constancy between traces during animations and
            transitions.
        uirevision
            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
            `selectedpoints` is controlled by
            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
            the same trace has a different index, you can still
            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
        unselected
            plotly.graph_objs.bar.Unselected instance or dict with
            compatible properties
        visible
            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
            visible).
        width
            Sets the bar width (in position axis units).
        widthsrc
            Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  width .
        x
            Sets the x coordinates.
        x0
            Alternate to `x`. Builds a linear space of x
            coordinates. Use with `dx` where `x0` is the starting
            coordinate and `dx` the step.
        xaxis
            Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and
            a 2D cartesian x axis. If "x" (the default value), the
            x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If "x2", the x
            coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
        xcalendar
            Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.
        xsrc
            Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  x .
        y
            Sets the y coordinates.
        y0
            Alternate to `y`. Builds a linear space of y
            coordinates. Use with `dy` where `y0` is the starting
            coordinate and `dy` the step.
        yaxis
            Sets a reference between this trace's y coordinates and
            a 2D cartesian y axis. If "y" (the default value), the
            y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If "y2", the y
            coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
        ycalendar
            Sets the calendar system to use with `y` date data.
        ysrc
            Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  y .
